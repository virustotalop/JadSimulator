# JadSimulator
Used to simulate jad from the fight caves in OSRS

# Whats working?
* At the moment nothing!
  * The prayer buttons are aligned but nothing is setup yet.
  * I need to do research on all the functions of how jad works.

# First time setup
* You need internet for the first time setup.
* Images are downloaded from the [rswiki](http://2007.runescape.wikia.com/).
* Once the images are downloaded you are able to start using the simulator.

# How to use
* Complete the first time setup.
* Press the start button.
* 5 seconds after the start button you will be able to start trying prayer switches.
* Currently the program only supports prayer switching, subject to change in the future.
